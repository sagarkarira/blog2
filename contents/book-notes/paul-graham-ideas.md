- The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a question.
- To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends.
- Universities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out of them.The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big company
- Practically every successful company has at least two. And because startup founders work under great pressure, it's critical they be friends.
- Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas.A function applied to an argument of the wrong type.
- I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem. You can't start with randomness. You have to start with a problem, then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.
- Finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it. Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.
- So if you want to start a startup, you can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, and assume you could build something way easier to use.
